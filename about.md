<br><br>
I am a software developer in Colorado, and I am most interested in high efficiency scientific computation, graphics, robotics, and systems programming.<br><br>I really enjoy low-level programming, I am fascinated by many things, including how software works at the hardware level. Im familiar with many different technologies but I am confident with Rust, Python, and Java, as well as git, github, arch linux, debian, and sql, just to name a few.<br><br>By far my favorite programming language is Rust, I am very excited to see how the language developes, and I hope that someday I can contribute to developing the language.<br><br>When I am not programming I enjoy running, mountain biking, rock climbing, and camping.
